we use the designed food cards to display the data, and in the middle of food cards, we marked the different labels with dinner, lunch, and breakfast, so that people can organize their meal separately, they also can set their own food card that we did display on the page to make their own preferences. And for designing every label, we use Ant Design UI components, which give us fancy label components that are well designed. Giving the different color on different type of data, vividly shows data on the cards.

The use table shows sample forms of food plans for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each shows three foods to support deletion. The image can be enlarged. We obtain food data from the user information collection list and then compare all the userâ€™s food calories with the maximum calorie combination. If the limit is exceeded, the daily calorie percentage will be calculated and displayed below. If the limit is exceeded, it will be displayed as an excess percentage. If you delete food, the values of the next three cards will change.
